In order to verify the dynamic monitoring results of temperature distribution for cable joints during operation period, the proposed method is compared with the finite element method. We have released the the test data and comparison results proposed in this article as open source. This data is only for research purposes and any commercial use requires our consent. For data sets, please contact the corresponding author.

The temperature scale is 270K -370K
